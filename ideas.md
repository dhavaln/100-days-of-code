## List of ideas that I might be implementing as part of the challenge.

* [For my SaaS-savvy friend, List of Followers with Email address for a Github Repo](/work/github_followers)
* For my Wife, Amazon Price Alert
* For my (future) kids, 5 Things to Teach my N Days Old Kid Today
* For myself, Tweet from Slack about my 100DaysOfCode progress
* For myself, Slack command to fetch picture from Door Camera (via Dropcam)
* For myself, Location based Reminders via Slack and Android app, things to do when I reach office/home/friend's home, my favorite cafe, etc
