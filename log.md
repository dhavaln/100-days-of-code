# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## I will be working on some of these [ideas](ideas.md)

### Day 0: 3rd Jan, 2017 (Github Followers)

**Today's Progress**: Basic setup done, Github profile and initial set of users are loading, but emails still missing out, it looks like I will need to fire individual requests for each of the follower to get their email address.

**Link to work**: [Github Followers](/work/github_followers)

### Day 1: 4th Jan, 2017 (Github Followers) ** Its my Birthday Today **

**Today's Progress**: Restructured the code a bit, sychronized the axios calls to fetch the user detail with email once the followers are loaded.

**Today's Progress**: Restructured the code a bit, loading emails in a sequence, some rendering issue with React but it was expected.
