# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## I will be working on some of these [ideas](ideas.md)

### Day 0: 3rd Jan, 2017 (Github Followers)

**Today's Progress**: Basic setup done, Github profile and initial set of users are loading, but emails still missing out, it looks like I will need to fire individual requests for each of the follower to get their email address.
