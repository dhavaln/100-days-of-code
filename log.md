# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## I will be working on some of these [ideas](ideas.md)

### Day 0: 3rd Jan, 2017 (Github Followers)

**Today's Progress**: Basic setup done, Github profile and initial set of users are loading, but emails still missing out, it looks like I will need to fire individual requests for each of the follower to get their email address.

### Day 1: 4th Jan, 2017 (Github Followers) ** Its my Birthday Today **

**Today's Progress**: Restructured the code a bit, sychronized the axios calls to fetch the user detail with email once the followers are loaded.

### Day 5: 10th Jan, 2017 (Github Followers)

**Today's Progress**: Writing bad code is sometimes fun, helps you understand how to make it correct. Big takeout from today's code: redux data normalization and component responsibilities.
